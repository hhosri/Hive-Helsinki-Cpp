In this repository you can find some of the projects that i've done through my software development studies at Hive Helsinki<br />

**What is Hive?** :bee:<br />
[Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en) is a coding school in Helsinki, Finland that takes part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).<br />
It's a school that preps you to launch your future-proofed career.<br />
